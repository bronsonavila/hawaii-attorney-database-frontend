```
yarn build
```

The built files will be in the `dist` directory.

## Testing

The project uses Vitest and React Testing Library for testing. The test suite covers component rendering, data validation, and utility functions. Test scripts can be found in the `package.json` file.

## Deployment

The application is deployed using Netlify with continuous deployment from the `main` branch. Build settings are configured in `netlify.toml`.

## Data Source

The attorney data is obtained from the [Hawaii State Bar Association's Member Directory](https://hsba.org/HSBA_2020/For_the_Public/Find_a_Lawyer/HSBA_2020/Public/Find_a_Lawyer.aspx). It is scraped and processed using a custom Node.js application from a [private backend repository](https://github.com/bronsonavila/hawaii-attorney-database-backend) and stored in a CSV file (`public/processed-member-records.csv`), which the application loads at runtime.
